<!-- Meaning of any three version -->

e.g, "nodemon": "^3.1.4"
"packageName": "^(major-version).(minor-version).(patch)"

it is a current version if change or new version so what happens
"packageName": "^(huge new releases and your code mo longer work if any change).(some/minor new features add but not introduce new package or not break your code).(bug-fixes)"

<!-- If check how many outdated packages -->

npm outdated

if you want to check the old version like first install e.g.
npm install slugify@1.0.0

now check the outdated packages versions

npm outdated

so install latest
npm install slugify@latest

if check patch relases change(^ --> to ~) is se ap ka code break nahi hoga
"slugify": "~1.3.4"

(^ --> to *) if check all of the versions is se ap ka code break nahi hoga
"slugify": "*1.3.4"

but good is to use ^ means the use and check currect version

<!-- Delete Package -->

npm uninstall packageName
